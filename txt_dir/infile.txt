Top 100 TV Markets 
The Television & Cable Factbook shows market ranks of all cable communities listed in the directory. The numbered markets are based on Section 76.51 of the 
Federal Communications Commission's cable television mies, and are shown in the following list. Other designations used in the Television & Cable Factbook 
are Below 100 and Outside TV Markets, based on a 35-mile radius from a city with commercial TV service. Below 100 markets include all cities not on the fol?
lowing list, which have one or more commercial TV stations. If a community is within the radii of both a numbered and a "Below 100＜ market, only the numbered 
rank is shown. In a few areas of the country, communities may lie within more than one numbered market, in which case both are shown. Communities beyond 
the 35-mile radius of the city of license of any commercial TV broadcast station are labeled "Outside TV Markets".
